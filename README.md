## Setting the environment variables 

Before running the above code, we will have to set two environment varibales

	export SYSTEM_KEY='a0b1c6ca0b9cdb89d3f9ea82e86a'
	export SYSTEM_SECRET='A0B1C6CA0BE8F8DFA7ABF198A864'

I have used [psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python library to send the cpu status.
